'''Python modules are simply files that contain Python code. 
They can define functions, classes, and variables, and can also include runnable code.
Modules help organize code into manageable sections, making it easier to maintain, reuse, and share.'''

#You can use built-in modules like math and os without needing to write them yourself.
import math

print(math.sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0
